            My name is Emran Kamil, and I have been involved in Full-stack
            development for some time, specializing in Backend development.
            Throughout my career, I have developed a strong skill set in
            creating Robust, scale-able and user-friendly interfaces and have a
            deep understanding of these technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am proficient in Python, go, JavaScript, and Java, and have
            expertise in frameworks like Nestjs, Nextjs, Django and flask.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally my active involvement with A2SV (African to Silicon
            Valley â€” backed by Google) has strengthened my understanding of
            advanced data structures and algorithms, solving over 800 problems
            on LeetCode and Codeforces.
